# Product Guide: SuburbMates Melbourne

## 1. Core Identity & Vision

SuburbMates Melbourne is a localized, mobile-first "Directory + Marketplace" designed to connect digital creators with local buyers. It operates on a strict "Middleman Truth" architecture, functioning as a high-trust discovery layer rather than a merchant of record.

Our core model is that of a **Shopping Mall**: SuburbMates provides the venue, visibility, and credibility, while individual **Creators** are the store owners who sell their own products and are responsible for their customers.

## 2. Target Audience

*   **Creators:** Local digital creators, designers, photographers, and other creative professionals based in Melbourne who want to be discovered and sell digital products directly to customers.
*   **Customers:** Individuals and businesses looking to discover and hire local talent or purchase high-quality digital goods from local creators.

## 3. Key Features & Functionality

*   **Local Directory:** A comprehensive directory of local creative businesses, including both **Claimed Listings** (managed by Creators) and **Unclaimed Listings** (available for claiming).
*   **Digital Marketplace:** A marketplace where Creators can list and sell a predefined number of digital products directly to customers.
*   **Studio Pages & Pro Mini-sites:** Every claimed listing gets a public-facing **Studio Page**. Creators can upgrade to a **Pro Mini-site**, which unlocks advanced customization, a "Spotlight" feature to highlight specific offerings, and a "Share Kit" for distribution.
*   **Tiered System:**
    *   **Basic (Free):** Allows a creator to have a Studio Page and publish a limited number of products.
    *   **Pro (Paid):** Unlocks the Pro Mini-site mode with more product listings and enhanced visibility.
    *   **Featured Placement (Paid Add-on):** A time-bound add-on for top placement in search results.
*   **ABN Verification:** An optional but encouraged identity verification system to build trust. This is independent of paid tiers.

## 4. Core Principles

*   **Truth UI:** The platform prioritizes credibility over conversion. All paid placements are explicitly labeled, and the platform's role as a middleman is always clear. We forbid "fake scale" metrics and other deceptive patterns.
*   **Premium Minimalism & Top-Tier Design:** The design philosophy rejects generic, AI-like templates in favor of an editorial, minimalist aesthetic that emphasizes quality typography, spacing, and imagery. The design must feel premium and trustworthy, explicitly avoiding common "cheap" visual effects like glows and overuse of dark mode.
*   **Automation for a Solo Operator:** The platform is designed to be fully AI-automated post-launch for a single operator. All technical and operational decisions must prioritize the least-cost, most efficient automated solution to minimize manual intervention.
