Audience: Product, Design, Automation, Operator  
Change Rule: Amendments require explicit rationale + downstream impact review

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines what SuburbMates is and is not.

It exists to:
- Prevent scope drift
- Prevent trust erosion
- Prevent operator burnout
- Prevent future contributors from “optimising away” core principles

If a feature, UI, automation, or policy contradicts this document, the feature is invalid.

---

## 2. What SuburbMates Is

### 2.1 A Discovery Layer (Primary)
SuburbMates is a local discovery platform.

It exists to:
- Surface local listings (claimed and unclaimed)
- Help users discover creators in their suburb or council
- Provide credible signals, not promises

SuburbMates does not guarantee outcomes, quality, availability, or fulfilment.

---

### 2.2 A Marketplace Layer (Secondary)
SuburbMates also provides a marketplace surface for Creators to sell digital products.

Key characteristics:
- Creators own their products
- Payments are processed via Stripe
- Products are sold by Creators, not by SuburbMates

The marketplace is an extension of discovery, not the core business.

---

### 2.3 A Shopping Mall Model (Non-Negotiable)
SuburbMates operates like a shopping mall, not a department store.

- The mall provides:
  - Visibility
  - Infrastructure
  - Credibility gates
- Individual stores (Creators) provide:
  - Products
  - Fulfilment
  - Support

SuburbMates is not the merchant of record.

---

## 3. What SuburbMates Is Not

### 3.1 Not a Merchant of Record
SuburbMates:
- Does not fulfil products
- Does not manage refunds
- Does not handle delivery disputes

Refunds and delivery issues are handled between Customer and Creator.

---

### 3.2 Not a Managed Services Platform
SuburbMates:
- Does not provide SLAs
- Does not mediate individual customer disputes
- Does not act as customer support for Creator products

Support responsibilities are federated, not centralised.

---

### 3.3 Not a Website Builder
SuburbMates:
- Is not a free-form website builder
- Does not allow arbitrary layouts, CSS, or branding

Creators are given constraint-based control, not total freedom.

---

## 4. Trust & Truth Principles (“Truth UI”)

### 4.1 Credibility Over Conversion
SuburbMates prioritises:
- Accurate representation
- Verifiable claims
- Honest limitations

Over:
- Inflated marketing language
- “Fake scale” signals
- Conversion dark patterns

---

### 4.2 Forbidden Signals
The platform must never allow:
- “Trusted by thousands” without proof
- Fake team imagery
- Implied endorsements
- AI-generated authority language

Violation is grounds for:
- Warning
- Delisting
- Suspension
- Eviction

---

### 4.3 Explicit Truth Statements
Where relevant, the platform must explicitly state:
- “Sold by [Creator]”
- “Payments processed by Stripe”
- “SuburbMates is a discovery platform”

Ambiguity is considered a defect.

---

## 5. Listings, Creators, and Ownership

### 5.1 Listings Come First
- The Directory may contain unclaimed listings
- Listings may be scraped or seeded
- Unclaimed listings do not represent active participation

Unclaimed listings exist for discoverability only.

---

### 5.2 Claiming Creates a Creator
Once a Listing is claimed:
- The owner becomes a Creator
- The Creator gains access to a private Studio
- The public destination becomes a Studio page

This is a state transition, not a content creation event.

---

## 6. Tiers Are Capability Unlocks, Not Status

### 6.1 Basic (Free)
Basic Creators:
- Have a Studio page
- Can list limited products
- Are discoverable
- Are not disadvantaged visually

Basic is a credible default, not a teaser.

---

### 6.2 Pro (Paid)
Pro unlocks:
- Mini-site mode (same URL)
- Share Kit
- Spotlight
- Advanced ordering and pinning
- Theme “Vibe” tuning

Pro is about distribution power, not vanity.

---

### 6.3 Verification Is Not Paywalled
Verification:
- Is independent of tier
- Must be mechanism-backed
- Must clearly state what is verified

Paid verification is forbidden.

---

## 7. Automation Bias (Solo Operator Safety)

### 7.1 Automation Is Mandatory Where Possible
Any workflow that:
- Is repetitive
- Is rule-based
- Does not require judgment

Must be automated.

Manual work is treated as technical debt.

---

### 7.2 No Silent State Changes
The system must not:
- Change public presentation
- Reorder content
- Switch modes

Without:
- Creator opt-in, or
- Explicit notification + undo

Trust beats cleverness.

---

## 8. Enforcement & Governance

### 8.1 Enforcement Focus
Enforcement exists to:
- Maintain platform credibility
- Prevent fraud
- Enforce Truth UI

Not to arbitrate commerce.

---

### 8.2 Escalation Ladder
All enforcement follows:
1. Warn
2. Delist
3. Suspend
4. Evict

Automation may assist, but final eviction is human-confirmed.

---

## 9. Non-Goals (Explicit)

The following are explicitly out of scope:
- Customer support for Creator products
- Refund handling
- Dispute arbitration
- White-label storefronts
- Multi-Creator cart ownership

Requests in these areas should be rejected by default.

---

## 10. Governance Rule

If a future decision conflicts with this document:
- This document wins
- Or this document must be amended explicitly

Silently violating it is not allowed.
